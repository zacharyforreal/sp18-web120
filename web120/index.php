 <p>My name is Xing Li, and you can just call me Zack. I was born and raised in China. I came to United States a few years ago and earned my accounting degree last year. After one years' work as accounting assistant, I'm back to school to learn some practical IT skills. I sitll want to continue my career as an <em>accountant</em>, and I do believe that mastery in <strong>IT</strong> would benefit me a lot.</p>
 <p>I have already taken Web 110 and Web 120 is funny so far. I will probably chose web design as my major, but I'd love to keep an open mind. Maybe I will love programming more, after I take some programing classes next quarter, who knows?</p>
